      means of their subsistence, food is always more or less in demand. It can
      always purchase or command a greater or smaller quantity of labour, and
      somebody can always be found who is willing to do something in order to
      obtain it. The quantity of labour, indeed, which it can purchase, is not

      Capitation Taxes.


[Document 2017]
      The impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their revenue, by
      any capitation, seems to have given occasion to the invention of taxes
      upon consumable commodities. The state not knowing how to tax, directly
      and proportionably, the revenue of its subjects, endeavours to tax it
      indirectly by taxing their expense, which, it is supposed, will, in most

[Document 2010]
      Such taxes, therefore, if it is attempted to render them equal, become
      altogether arbitrary and uncertain; and if it is attempted to render them
      certain and not arbitrary, become altogether unequal. Let the tax be light
      or heavy, uncertainty is always a great grievance. In a light tax, a
      considerable degree of inequality may be supported; in a heavy one, it is

      commodities, and sometimes by encouraging smuggling frequently afford a
